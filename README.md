# ATM Simulator

## Overview
The **ATM Simulator** is a C++ console application that mimics the basic functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). The program allows users to log in with an account number and PIN, check their account balance, and withdraw money. It is designed as a simple project to demonstrate basic concepts in C++ such as classes, user input handling, and conditional logic.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can log in using their account number and PIN.
- **Balance Inquiry**: Users can check their current account balance.
- **Cash Withdrawal**: Users can withdraw money from their account, with the balance updated in real-time.
- **Error Handling**: The application provides feedback for invalid inputs, such as incorrect PINs or insufficient funds.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/atm-simulator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd atm-simulator
   ```
3. Compile the source code:
   ```bash
   g++ atm_simulator.cpp -o atm_simulator
   ```
4. Run the executable:
